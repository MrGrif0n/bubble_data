## **Bubble Chain Visualization**

### **Description**
This program reads a `.txt` file, analyzes word frequencies, and generates a bubble chain visualization. The size of each bubble represents the frequency of the word, and connections between bubbles indicate word co-occurrence.

### **Setup Instructions**

1. **Install Python**
   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Check your version with:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   Create and activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Inside the virtual environment, install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib networkx
   ```

### **Usage Instructions**

1. **Prepare Your Text File**
   - Save your `.txt` file in the same directory as the script.
   - Ensure it's named `your_file.txt` or update the filename in the script.

2. **Run the Program**
   - Execute the Python script:
     ```bash
     python bubble_chain.py
     ```

3. **View the Visualization**
   - The program generates a bubble chain graph showing word relationships.
   - Adjust the threshold or relationships logic in the script as needed.

### **Notes**
- Ensure the `.txt` file is cleaned and formatted (e.g., remove non-text data).
- If you need additional libraries, activate the virtual environment before installing them.
